# MVP Idea
- Technical Stack Components:
    Vapi AI for handling voice calls
    Groq for language processing and decision making
    Storage system for call records and customer data -> Don't complicate it, just a folder

- Core Process Flow:
    Incoming Call → Vapi handles voice → Groq processes conversation → Store Information

- Key Functions Needed:
    Call initiation and management -> Sheet with name and numbers
    Natural conversation flow -> Vapi AI 
    Information extraction -> Groq (llama3.3)
    Data storage -> Folder called database
    Ticket/report generation -> Function agentic (langchain)
    Get info from the company -> docs
    
-> Buying a number in VAPI is required
